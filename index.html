        <div class="text">We are grateful to the heroes that answer the call to serve and take an 
          oath to defend and protect our freedom. How can the rest of us serve 
          those who put our country first? By taking care of what's most precious 
          to them, their children. There are 2 million children with a parent serving 
          in the military. Too often military kids feel these burdens alone, putting 
          them at risk for a range of emotional and behavioral problems, as well as 
          poor academic outcomes. Our vision is to ensure all military children 
          receive the support they need to thrive.

        <div class="header">Our Challenge</div>
        <div class="text">We found that a parent deploying often leads to anger, confusion, and sadness. Military children are often asked to 
          make this sacrifice, and the effects of uncertainty, fear, and loss at such a young age can be crippling. Imagine the 
          fear of a parent leaving for what seems to be forever - sometimes never returning. Parents that return suffer 
          physically, emotionally, or mentally. As a child, this is impossible to comprehend. Their lives can be isolating, leading 
          to academic struggle, emotional limitations, and substance abuse. The children of our heroes should not be 
          overlooked. We want to provide them with the tools and strategies to properly process their experiences.
